    "The running time complexity of Dijkstra’s algorithm depends on how the vertices are stored and retrieved. Generally, the min-priority queue is used to store the vertices of the graph, thus, the time complexity of Dijkstra’s algorithm depends on how the min-priority queue is implemented.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case, the vertices are stored numbered from 1 to |V| in an array. Here, each operation for searching a vertex from the entire array will take O(V) time, making the total time complexity O(V2 V2 + E) = O(V2). Furthermore, if the min-priority queue is implemented using the Fibonacci heap, the time taken for each iteration of the loop and extracting the minimum node will take O(|V|) time. Further, iterating over all the vertices’ adjacent nodes and updating the shortest distance takes O(|E|) time, and each priority value update takes O(log|V|) time, which makes O(|E| + log|V|). Thus, the total running time complexity of the algorithm becomes O(|E| + |V|log |V|), where |V| is the number of vertices and |E| is the number of edges.”\n",
